mistune0 (0.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release of mistune0. (Closes: #1005722)
    (this is a repackaging of src:mistune flagged to be stuck at 0.8.4, as
    mistune >= 2 is not backward compatible and rev-deps are moving slowly)
    It is expected to be dropped before bookworm's release.
